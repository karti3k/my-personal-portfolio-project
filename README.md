# My Personal Portfolio Project 1.0

## About This Project
This project is my old personal portfolio website. I created it to showcase my work (front-end, graphic design, video editing), skills, and to provide all relevant contact links in one place. A personal portfolio is essential for displaying one's professional journey, and this project served as a practical application of my skills.

### Inspiration and Design
The design, particularly the navbar and homepage and project section, was inspired by a project guide of a YouTube channel called [WebDecoded](https://youtu.be/hYv6BM2fWd8?si=IWzLsqs424Uu3stU). In the referenced video, React.js and React Bootstrap were used. However, I decided to build my personal website using the React.js library and plain CSS3 without any CSS frameworks. I provided my own theme and made changes to the design, particularly in the skills section and footer, as it was my first time creating a portfolio website for myself.

### What I Learned
At the time, I had just finished learning React, and this project was a fantastic opportunity to implement the concepts practically. Through this process, I created a beautiful portfolio with the theme I envisioned, which was appreciated by my college friends for its design, especially on mobile. I also refreshed my CSS3 skills and improved my understanding of responsiveness.
